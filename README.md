## About:
Okay enough mythology now let's jump right in!! This is a model that employs NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmented Topologies) to train the Submarine in a simulated OpenAI Gym environment aimed to move in a real-time subnautic environment with obstacles. The model which will later be transferred to a Raspberry Pi, mapping the controls accordingly and adding to the pipeline a camera input.
## Vision:
This project is aimed at making a sustainable, scalable and cost-effective scouting submarine-like robot for monitoring small to medium water bodies for objects and possible threats.
